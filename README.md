Project Title: Diabetes Prediction Web App using Flask and Machine Learning

Objective:
Build a web-based tool to predict diabetes risk using a trained machine learning model, enhancing healthcare accessibility through early detection.

Data Processing:

Dataset preprocessed: handled missing values with imputation.

Applied scaling for normalization.

Used a Random Forest model for classification.

Model, scaler, and imputer saved using pickle for deployment.

Web App Features:

Frontend: HTML form to input patient details (e.g., glucose, blood pressure, BMI, age).

Backend: Flask handles routing and prediction logic.

Functionality:

Inputs passed through imputer and scaler.

Predicts outcome using Random Forest classifier.

Displays result: “Diabetic” or “Not Diabetic”.

Technical Stack:

Model: Random Forest

Backend: Python Flask

Preprocessing: Scikit-learn (Imputer, Scaler)

Deployment Tools: Pickle for model loading

Collaboration & Deployment:

Application designed to be shared via web browser.

Predictive logic modular for collaboration and improvement.

Skills Used:
Flask Web Framework, Machine Learning, Scikit-learn, Data Preprocessing, Model Deployment, HTML/CSS
